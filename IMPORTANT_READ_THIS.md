# Website-Tress
Ok so this particular project is no where close to done. but i figured that i might as well take the time to learn github while i am at it. 
it is incredibly nerve racking to imagine the lack of basic introductory tutorials there are to this concept. 
oh well, i guess one day i might need to make one myself.
anyways:
my focus here was to get the site to be responsive. most of the functions i still very much lack. but the basic layout exist now
one can only build up from here!!!
