<!--Before anything gets started, i like to throw out the concept idea i am going for. with this particular project and on most of my many others
i like to follow a pattern. i am quite sure there is a name for such practice, but i am not sure i remember it. anyway, the design focus
of this website is to make it simplistic, functional, but yet very stylistic. i want it to match the 4th generation gaming design pattern,
simple yet beautiful-->

                “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” -- Maya Angelou.<br> This particular quote has been the driven force behind every single bonding of the oxygen atoms that fuels air to my lungs from even before I could remember taking breath. This particular mentality helps fuel my passion for people, problem solving, and community building. <br> While a simple goal can serve as motivation that pushes use through most struggles, most times through the hard times it is our values and passion themselves that help carry us through the breaking points. I bring this passion into every living aspects of my life: people, art, development, and much more.<br> The greatest skill I learned in the recent years is the importance of realizing that regardless of how great our individual achievements are, what they mean to others and how they affect the immediate world we live in immortalizes them and makes them of value.

            		<h1>Aspiration</h1>
                </header>
                <p>
                My aspirations are the particular reason for my motivation. As a child and even as an adult I have fascinated over the works of individuals such as: Michael Jackson, Walt Disney, Maya Angelou, Bell Hooks, Stan Lee, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King JR, and so much more. While each one of these named individuals are quite different from one another, some more so than the others, there is a similarity amongst them that I aspire to; the similarity being, the transformative daring approach to living, being, and connecting with the world around them, through which they bring who they are and what they know to further enrich the world.<br>
According to Albert Einstein “The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination.” My aspirations overall is to be the best imaginative, creative, and passionate me I could possibly be in my lifetime.

            		<h1>Hello there</h1>
            	<p>
                The name is Tress Idehen as you may already know, this particular website I created while attending my first Tech Training Program known as Npower Canada, here in Toronto.<br>
                
                This particular space exist to help navigate, collect and track my tech journey, accomplishments, interests and showcase the many other amazing individual I come across through it. Undeniably, it serves to also nourish the philosophy upon which I face every task, projects, life, or problems.<br>
                I consider myself a web, software, and app developer in training. My passion as you may also already know revolves around creating and connecting the artists (people) story (life), to the development/use/experience of tech; whether it is media, graphic design, applications or hardware the ultimate goal is to manifest the magical human components and philosophy of transformative connections into how we do tech.<br>
                I have recently acquired my MTA (Microsoft Technology Associates) certifications. If you follow my projects and interest links you will find some of the interesting developments and artistry I have had the opportunity to learn and develop. In an age where knowledge is for the first time attainable at the click of finger, I aim to learn all that I can in the time that I am here. To one day receive the opportunity to give back as much knowledge, support and creative input to the world that has already given me so much.<br>
                Enjoy the contents, and do not hesitate to contact me if need ever arise. I am best reached through LinkedIn, but any other source as provide is easily just as good, thank you very much for the visit and have a fantastic day!
